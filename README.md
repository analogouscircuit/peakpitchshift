# How To Pick a Peak
This repository contains all the essential code necessary to reproduce the results presented in Dahlbom and Braasch (2020),
including a complete implementation of the pitch model presented there. Precise reproduction of the figures requires trial data
that are not included in this repository (they are too large), but I am happy to provide them on request.

The code here can be taken as a general framework for matching "adaptive templates" to one-dimensional data, using mathematical techniques similar to those
presented in the work of William Sethares (see, for example, his [book](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781846286391) on rhythm).  

The pitch model itself can be run by calling the function `estimate_Ï„0` from the PitchModelPeaks.jl module.  This is a rather
monstrous function, which includes many options for making comparisons with other models and generating graphs, but
it can be called in a straightforward way simply by providing a signal and a sample rate.

The paper also contains an appendix providing the results of the simulation of a bushy
cell in the cochlear nucleus recieving a nearly-harmonic input signal.  This material is contained in a separate repository, 
namely this one.
